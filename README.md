# TelegramBot
At first need create a directory "image".
In bot father need create bot and get token for bot and insert in create_bot.py.
SOCKS5 proxy also configured in create_bot.py.
Need create Data channel add there bot and give him admin.
To download all data with Data channel need Telegram account(because this function can do only with user API) and get api_id and api_hash and
insert them in create.bot.py.
And you need to get id Data channel and in bot_handlers.py and all_download.py  insert it(I emphasized where it need to do).
And at last need to start main.py script.
P.S You have to use the download all data once to authorize and get the session file for telegram user API.
